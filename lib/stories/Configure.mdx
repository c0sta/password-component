# Configuration

Follow these steps to run the library locally using Storybook or install it on other project locally using `npm link`.

## 1. Prerequisites

- Repository clone
- Node 20.11
- NPM
- Docker _(Optional)_
  > If you have `docker`/`docker-compose` installed, run `docker-compose up` inside the project folder and wait the script to install the dependencies and execute the Storybook service on port `6006`.

## 2. Installing

Once you have the repository cloned locally on your machine, install the dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

## 3. Running

### Storybook

Since this is a library we don't have a `npm run dev` script, so our Development Server is the Storybook by itself.

```bash
npm run storybook
```

### Linking to other project

Linking the repo makes possible to install the library on another project without the necessity to publish it to a external registry.

To do so, run the following command's inside the local repository path:

#### Library

**1.** Build the project:

```bash
npm run build
```

**2.** Link it using `npm` to create a symlink to the library:

```bash
npm link
```

#### External project

**1.** Now link the external project with the local library

```bash
npm link password-component
```

**2.** Confirm that a reference to the library inside the external project `node_modules` was created correctly, like the example below:

{" "}

<br />
<div style={{ padding: 16 }}>
  <img
    src={LinkLibraryReference}
    alt="Library symlink example inside node_modules folder"
  />
</div>
**3.** Import it:

```tsx
import "password-component/dist/style.css";
import { PasswordInput } from "password-component/dist/index.es";
```
